# ROS install on ubuntu 20.04
Everyone needs to go through this site to install. There are 3 sites to install it. I will put pictures for you at the end.

1. The first is to go to VirtualBox

https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

So that we have to install Ubuntu through which we will be able to install the rose

2. Second, go to ubuntu and install version 20.04

Https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/

3. Third, go to the last site, Ros.org.

https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu

To install it by orders

4.When downloading the above first, the VirtualBox window will be opened, choose New, then add personal information and complete the procedures. Etc..

5. A speaking program will be selected, which is Ubuntu, which will be selected and uploaded and we will wait for the program to be downloaded and installed.

6. Finally, we will see the Ubuntu window. We will go to search for the Terminal program for orders, which will be one of the third step.

7. The Ros website and the command window will be opened, go to the noetic version 20.04 and start copying the orders and placing them in the command window and after each order you will click on enter. Etc.. From beginning to last order.

8. Until this screen appears.
